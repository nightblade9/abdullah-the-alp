# Abdullah the Warrior

A modern terminal C# roguelike/roguelite. The target user experience is a single warrior battling overwhelming hordes to rescue his family.

It plays like a modern game rendered in ASCII, not like an oldschool terminal roguelike.

# Planned Features

- Customizable play with three distinct styles to mix-and-match
- A gripping story about family, oppression, and monsters
- Unique battles against hordes of enemies at once
- Enemies with telegraphed moves that you can react to
